# Module_18_challenge
My submission for the module 18 chellenge

# God bless y'all for this one 

# Included are photos of the blockchain with several blocks, as well as a photo of the blockchain being validated
# This module was a really fun one, but a lot to digest all at once. We used Python and Streamlit to create a basic web app that could display data from a blockchain network.
